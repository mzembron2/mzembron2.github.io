## Intro

This project is a simple flashcard application that helps you learn anything using [spaced repetition method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition), which will allow you to do it noticeably faster. Flashcards can contain text, images, or sound (there is an easy way to add new ones through the application). The implemented algorithm calculates new repetition dates according to the [SuperMemo-2 method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo#Description_of_SM-2_algorithm).

## Tools used 

The whole application is written in C++11. Nearly every part is made with the help of the Qt5 framework(from GUI to connecting to the database). All flashcards data is stored in the SQLite database.
