## Intro

This project provides the implementation of an evolutionary algorithm for optimization of occupated space in the warehouse. During the evolution, the algorithm considers whether there is access to each item stored in the warehouse - if not, a penalty is applied to the score.

## Tools used 

The whole application is written in python. For data-wrangling necessary were: NumPy and Pandas. Easy-to-use GUI was created with help of the Streamlit library.

## The way it works 

## Example solution:
